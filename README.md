# Hello!

I am a data engineer, web developer, and developer advocate!

Previously, I worked at [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/) building the future of finance, and the [Massive Data Institute](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/) at [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu) building data warehousing solutions for social scientists and researchers to leverage large-scale organic data.
