# Welcome!

I am a data engineer and web developer helping build the future of finance at Gemini.

Previously, I worked at the [Massive Data Institute](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/research/the-massive-data-institute/) at [Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu), building data warehousing and processing solutions for social scientists and researchers to leverage large-scale organic data.
